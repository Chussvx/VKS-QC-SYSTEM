### 3. Incident Management & Support
The QC Inspector is the first responder (digitally or physically) to issues.
*   **Incident Logging**: Record theft, damage, or fights in the *Incidents* module.
*   **Complaint Resolution**: Investigate client complaints (e.g., "Guard was rude") and document findings.

### 4. Reporting & Guidance
